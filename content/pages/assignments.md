There will be three papers for this course: two short papers (4â€“5 pages each) and one longer final paper (8-10 pages). I will provide a long list of topics and questions for each paper for you to choose from. These will be analytical essays (with a thesis, textual analysis as evidence, a rigorous conclusion), they will be comparative (asking you to think about multiple texts from our course), and they will ask you to reflect on or engage with critical and theoretical questions.
